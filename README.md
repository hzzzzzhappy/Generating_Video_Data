ðŸ˜Š This library contains some common data for training video generation models. Regardless of which data you need, the following steps:
```bash
mkdir data
cd data
```
Next, go to my cloud database [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HanzheL/Generating_Video_Data/blob/main/README.md) and download the data you want into the folder```data/```.
Once you've downloaded the data you need, we've found preprocessing steps from its official implementation, which you can follow to process the data.
For memory requirements, we provide the files as single zip files, you need to extract the file named data_name.rar with the unzip command: ```unrar x data_name.rar```
